9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    PYTHON INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS
    Installing and configuring Python involves several straightforward steps. Below, I'll outline the process for installing Python on a Windows system and basic configuration steps:

Installing Python on Windows
Download Python Installer:

Visit the official Python website and download the latest version of Python (preferably Python 3.x) 

Run Python Installer:

Once the download is complete, run the installer (python-3.x.x.exe).

Check the box that says "Add Python x.x to PATH" during the installation process.

Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type: python --version

Installing Python on Windows
Download Python Installer:

Visit the official Python website and download the latest version of Python (preferably Python 3.x).
Run Python Installer:

Once the download is complete, run the installer (python-3.x.x.exe).
Check the box that says "Add Python x.x to PATH" during the installation process.
Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type: python --version.

Configuring Python Environment Variables (Optional)

VISUAL STUDIO CODE INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Installing and configuring Visual Studio Code (VS Code) involves a few straightforward steps. Below, I'll outline the process for installing VS Code on Windows and basic configuration steps to get you started:

Installing Visual Studio Code on Windows
Download VS Code Installer:

Visit the official Visual Studio Code website and download the installer for Windows.

Run VS Code Installer:

Once the download is complete, run the installer (VSCodeSetup-x64-x.x.x.exe).
Follow the prompts to install VS Code with the default settings.

Launch VS Code:

After installation, launch VS Code by double-clicking its icon on the desktop or from the Start menu.
Basic Configuration of Visual Studio Code

Extensions:

VS Code supports extensions that provide additional features and language support. Here are some essential extensions for Python development:
Python Extension: Provides Python language support, debugging, and IntelliSense.

Visual Studio IntelliCode: Enhances IntelliSense with AI-assisted recommendations.

GitLens: Adds Git version control features directly into VS Code.

To install extensions:

Click on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for the extension you want to install, then click "Install".

Configure Python Interpreter:

Open a Python project or create a new one.
Open the Command Palette (press Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).

Type and select "Python: Select Interpreter".
Choose the Python interpreter from your virtual environment (venv directory) if you've created one.
Settings:

Customize VS Code settings by clicking on the gear icon on the lower left corner (Settings) or by pressing Ctrl+, (comma).
Modify settings such as font size, theme, and editor preferences to suit your needs.
Integrated Terminal:

VS Code includes an integrated terminal that you can use to run commands directly within the editor.
Open the integrated terminal with Ctrl+` (backtick).
Debugging:

VS Code provides a powerful debugging interface. To set up a debugger:
Create or open a Python file.
Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to line numbers.
Use F5 or click on the debug icon on the Sidebar to start debugging.
Version Control with Git:

If you have Git installed (if not, install it from git-scm.com), you can use it directly within VS Code.
Initialize a Git repository or open an existing one using the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G).
Example Workflow
Install VS Code:

Download and run the VS Code installer from the official website.
Launch VS Code:

Open VS Code from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
Install Extensions:

Install essential extensions like Python, Visual Studio IntelliCode, and GitLens.
Configure Python:

Select the Python interpreter from your virtual environment using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P > "Python: Select Interpreter").
Start Coding:

Open a Python file (File > Open Folder) or create a new one.
Write Python code, save the file with a .py extension, and run/debug it directly from VS Code.
Manage Version Control:

Use Git commands within VS Code or through the integrated Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) to manage version control.

Installation of virtualenv(Virtual Environment)

Install virtualenv:

Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.
Install virtualenv using pip (assuming Python and pip are already installed):
pip install virtualenv

This command installs virtualenv globally on your system.

Verify Installation:

After installation, verify virtualenv by checking its version:
virtualenv --version

This command should display the installed version of virtualenv.

Creating and Using Virtual Environments

Create a Virtual Environment:

Decide on a directory where you want to create the virtual environment (e.g., within your project directory).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
Create the Virtual Environment:

Use virtualenv to create a new virtual environment:
virtualenv venv
Replace venv with your preferred name for the virtual environment.

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

Your command prompt will now show the name of the virtual environment ((venv)).
Deactivate the Virtual Environment:

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your global Python environment, simply type:
deactivate
Example Workflow
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example to illustrate how you might use virtualenv in practice:

Create a New Project Directory:

Create a new directory for your Python project:
bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
Install virtualenv and Create Virtual Environment:

Install virtualenv if you haven't already (see installation steps above).
Create a virtual environment named venv:
virtualenv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Packages:

While the virtual environment is activated, install Python packages using pip. For example:
pip install numpy pandas

Deactivate the Virtual Environment:

Once you're done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:

deactivate

#Deliverables:
